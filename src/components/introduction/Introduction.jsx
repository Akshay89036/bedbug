          <h4>
            Are you losing the war on bed bugs? Have you been using sprays
            and powder and you are still getting bites?

          <p>
            Bed Bugs have become immune to the pesticide used by
            professional exterminators developed in the 1970s. Science has
            proven that heat treatment is the most effective method of
            killing all stages of a bed bugs and eggs within minutes after
            reaching the thermal death temperature of 45C. Our electric
            bug removal method uses electric heaters and is safe for
            everyone: your children, asthma sufferers, the elderly and
            your pets. Stay at home. There is no need to leave your house
            during the treatment as we heat one room at a time.
